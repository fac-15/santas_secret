# santas_secret

Week 8 project (Charlie, Hannah, Lucy, Oliver)

## Installation

- Clone repository
- Run ```npm install```
- Create ```config.env``` file and ask us for our DB URL (currently using one hosted on Heroku - we know, local databases would be better though! ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è)
- Run ```npm run start``` or ```npm run dev```

## Tuesday:

- Planning/Whiteboarding:
- Wanted the sports car, lots of discussion, we opted for the skateboard!

(Wanted multiple user authentication, inc. an organisation table in our db)
(Would ideally have completely annonymous results via login)

Instead our first draft is going to be for an admin/organiser, who inputs all the names, and sees all the results/who's allocated to who.

## Wednesday:

What we're proud of:

- TDD!
